prompt: |
  Generate a detailed and engaging story or continue an existing narrative based on the following inputs:

  Story Overview/Setting/Premise: {story_overview}
  Genre: {genre}
  Themes to Explore in the Story: {themes}
  Magic/Tech Rules (if applicable): {magic_or_tech_rules}
  Number of Major Characters in the Story: {major_characters}
  Key Character Traits or Archetypes (if provided): {character_traits}
  Feedback/New Guidance for Refinement or Continuation (if any): {feedback}
  Existing Story (if provided): {story}

  If the "Existing Story" is empty, create a new story that incorporates all the provided elements.
  If the "Existing Story" is not empty, treat it as established content and generate a continuation that naturally follows from where it left off. Do not alter or repeat any part of the existing narrative.

  Ensure that every input element is clearly and fully expressed in a cohesive narrative.

readme: |
  This flow supports interactive storytelling.
  In the initial phase, it generates a complete story based on your inputs and iterative feedback.
  Once the initial story is created, users can choose to either conclude it or continue it.
  In continuation mode, the established narrative is preserved exactly, and any new content is appended as a new segment.
